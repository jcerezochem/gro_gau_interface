Interface to use MM calculations with gromacs in G09 runs
===========================================================
Javier Cerezo, October 18, 2017

Description
------------
The interface consists of one bash script (gromacs_link.sh)
that manages the communication between gromcas and gaussian and 
two utilities (gau2gro and  gro2gau) called by the script to deal 
with the data preparation so as to exchange the information among
gromacs and gaussian.

The interface allows one to use a Gromacs calculation as calculation 
method within G09 through the External keyword. A minimal example 
route section would be a single point calculation as follows:

# external="gromacs_link.sh -p joyce.new.top"

The External method can be used in single point calculations, force
and frequency calculation. Optimizations (including constraint 
optimizations) are also possible. The external method can also be
used to specify the theoretical method of an ONIOM layer.


Installation
------------
The two utilities are written in C and Fortran, thus valid compilers
for such languages are needed (e.g., gcc and gfotran). 
The compilation can be performed from source/ folder using the simple
Makefile provided. Concretely typing:

 make                         - Compile the code in /source
 make install BINDIR=~/bin    - Install the binaries in ~/bin. Any other
                                path can be specified (but one MUST be 
                                given)
 make clean                   - Delete binaries

After compilation, both utilitities and the main bash script should be
placed on a folder that is in the PATH of your system.

Configuring gromacs setting:
..........................
The script should work with versions >= 4.5 but some configuration is
needed to account for syntax changes in most recent versions.
The configuration settings are specified in the gromacs_link.sh file
("GROMACS CONFIGURATION SECTION"). The following variables are set
gmxcall     - Name of the general gmx caller (in versons >5)
              Values: "" | gmx | gmx_d | gmx_mpi_d | (other caller names may apply)
gmxprefix   - sufix for tools (as g_energy in versions <5).
              Vaules: g_ | ""
gmxsufix    - sufix depending on compilation options (version <5): 
              Vaules: _d | _mpi_d | "" | (other suffix may be applicable)
dumprefix   - prefix for dump program (gmxdump in versions <5)
              Values: gmx | ""
addmdpgroup - handles the fact that group scheme is needed, but a new one
              was introduced in versions >5 and the mdp should be adapted
              Values: true | false

Example for version >5 compiled with mpi and double precision:
gmxcall="gmx_mpi_d"
gmxprefix=""
gmxsufix=""
dumprefix=""
addmdpgroup=true


Usage
------
The interface is called using the External keyword in the gaussian route
section:

# JobType External="gromacs_link.sh [options]"

where JobType is the type of run as usual (SP, Opt, Freq...). The interface
can be called with arguments in the route section, indicated as "-flag value"
The following options can be specified:

Flag     Ex. Value       Description
.......................................................
-p       topol.top       Topology file
-noclean (no arg)        Do not clean the directory
                         after the run (i.e., leave
                         intermediate gromacs files)
.......................................................
An additional argument can be given (with no -flag) which
is interpreted as the name of a paramter file, e.g. parameters.dat  

A topology file is mandatory (if not specified, "topol.top" will be 
assumed). The optional parameter file specifies more options to tune 
the calculation, including the use of strucuture files to indicate
the molecules in the ONIOM layers and the possibility to apply the
Microiterations algotithm within gromacs (as it is not available within
G09 with the External keyword). A complete list of options is shown 
below, in the systax they have in the file:

-- parameters.dat --
topfile_R         = topol.top       ; Topology of the R layer
topfile_M         = topol.top       ; Topology of the M layer
topfile_S         = topol.top       ; Topology of the S layer
grofile_R         = conf.g96        ; Structure in the R layer
grofile_M         = conf.g96        ; Structure in the M layer
grofile_S         = conf.g96        ; Structure in the S layer
nproc_gmx         = 1               ; integer - number of processors to use in the 
                                    ; gromacs run (only 1 processor works for the moment)
save_intermediate = false           ; true/false - controls if intermediate files are saved
job_type          = SinglePoint     ; SinglePoint/Minim - use minim for Microiterations
aa2ua_file        = aa2au.dat       ; File with mapping between All-Atoms and United-Atoms
-- parameters.dat --


Notes about the External keyword
---------------------------------
The External program cannot be used for geometry optiomizations wit Microiterations (althought 
ths can be solved letting the external program do such steps). There is however, a more 
relevant issue that is probably connected to this issue: Gasussian ignores the modredundant
section (e.g., to perform a constrained minimization) with an External method. To make it use
the modredundant section, use "Opt(NoMicro)".


Examples
---------
Here you have some example route sections:

* Single point calculation with MM potential
# SP External="gromacs_link.sh -p topol.top"

* Optimization and frequencies with MM potential
# Opt Freq External="gromacs_link.sh -p topol.top"

* Constrained optimization with MM potential
# Opt(modredundant,nomicro) External="gromacs_link.sh -p topol.top"

* ONIOM calculation, using the MM potential as the low layer:
# SP ONIOM(B3LYP/6-31G(d):External="gromacs_link.sh parameters.dat")
(the paremeters.dat file should indicate the topologies of the different layers)
